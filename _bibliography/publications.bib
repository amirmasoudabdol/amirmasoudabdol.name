abstract = {Efficient network inference is one of the challenges of current-day biology. Its application to the study of development has seen noteworthy success, yet a multicellular context, tissue growth, and cellular rearrangements impose additional computational costs and prohibit a wide application of current methods. Therefore, reducing computational cost and providing quick feedback at intermediate stages are desirable features for network inference. Here we propose a hybrid approach composed of two stages: exploration with scatter search and exploitation of intermediate solutions with low temperature simulated annealing. We test the approach on the well-understood process of early body plan development in flies, focusing on the gap gene network. We compare the hybrid approach to simulated annealing, a method of network inference with a proven track record. We find that scatter search performs well at exploring parameter space and that low temperature simulated annealing refines the intermediate results into excellent model fits. From this we conclude that for poorly-studied developmental systems, scatter search is a valuable tool for exploration and accelerates the elucidation of gene regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Understanding genetic interactions during early development of a given organism, is the first step toward unveiling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern a biological process of interest. Predicting such interactions from large expression datasets by performing targeted knock-down/knock-out approaches is a challenging task. We use the currently available expression datasets (in situ hybridization images & qPCR time series) for a basal anthozoan the sea anemone N. vectensis to construct continuous spatiotemporal gene expression patterns during its early development. Moreover, by combining cluster results from each dataset we develop a method that provides testable hypotheses about potential genetic interactions. We show that the analysis of spatial gene expression patterns reveals functional regions of the embryo during the gastrulation. The clustering results from qPCR time series unveils significant temporal events and highlights genes potentially involved in N. vectensis gastrulation. Furthermore, we introduce a method for merging the clustering results from spatial and temporal datasets by which we can group genes that are expressed in the same region and at the time. We demonstrate that the merged clusters can be used to identify GRN interactions involved in various processes and to predict possible activators or repressors of any gene in the dataset. Finally, we validate our methods and results by predicting the repressor effect of NvErg on NvBra in the central domain during the gastrulation that has recently been confirmed by functional analysis.}

abstract = {Studying the spatial gene expression profiles from in situ hybridization images of the embryo is one of the first steps toward the comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in an organism. In the case of N. vectensis, extracting and collecting these data is a challenging task due to the difficulty of detecting the cell layer through the transparent body plan and changing morphology during the blastula and gastrula stages. Here, first, we introduce a method to algorithmically identify and track the cell layer in N. vectensis embryo from the late blastula to the late gastrula stage. With this, we will be able to extract spatial expression profiles of genes alongside the cell layer and consequently reconstructing the 1D representation of gene expression profiles. Furthermore, we use the morphological configurations of the embryo extracted from confocal images, to model the dynamics of embryos morphology during the gastrulation process in 2D. Ultimately, we provide a visualization tool for studying and comparing the extracted spatial gene expression profiles over the simulated embryo. We anticipate that our method of extraction and visualization to be a starting point for quantifying and collecting more in situ images from various sources, which can potentially accelerate our understanding of gene interactions in the early development of N. vectensis. The method allows researchers to visualize and compare the different gene expressions from different in situ images or different experiments. As an example, we were able to show the complementary expression of NvFoxA-NvSnailA and NvBra-NvErg in the central domain and central/external rings during the development which suggests the possible repression effects between each pair; as it has been discovered by functional analysis.}
