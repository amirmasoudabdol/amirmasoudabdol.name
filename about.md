<!-- # About Me -->

I am an applied mathematician, *remotely* a computer scientist, and recently more of a [computational scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_scientist). For my Ph.D. thesis, I have studied and modeled biological systems at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl) at the University of Amsterdam.

Currently, I am working as a postdoc researcher at the [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics/) at the Tilburg University, in the Netherlands. I am interested in applications of Machine Learning to detect and reduce the statistical errors in psychological studies.

Besides all that mathematics, statistics, computings, biology and modelings, I am a design enthusiast. I enjoy designing, criticizing and studying Human User Interfaces either for smartphones or desktops. I also love typography. I'm always in a look out to find new and interesting typefaces. [Nitti](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti/) and [Nitti Grotesk](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti-grotesk/) are two of my favorite families.

By the way, I'm trying to maintain a **[/now]({{ site.url }}/now)** page!
