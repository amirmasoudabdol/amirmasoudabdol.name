<!-- # About Me -->

I am an applied mathematician, *remotely* a computer scientist, and a trained [computational scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_scientist). For my [Ph.D. thesis]({{ site.url }}/phd), I have studied and modeled biological systems at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl) at the University of Amsterdam. During my PostDoc at the [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics/) at the Tilburg University, in the Netherlands. I have utilized my interdisciplinary knowledge of complex system simulation and software engineering to design and develop a modular, flexible and extensible C++ simulator from scratch. [SAM](https://sam.amirmasoudabdol.name), Science Abstract Model Simulation Framework, is designed to facilitate the process of studying researchersâ€™ degrees of freedom and their propagative effect on meta-analytic metrics and publication bias across the entire process of performing a research.

Besides all that mathematics, statistics, computing, biology and modelings, I am a design enthusiast. I enjoy designing, criticizing and studying Human User Interfaces either for smartphones or desktops. I also love typography. I'm always in a look out for new and interesting typefaces. [Nitti](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti/) and [Nitti Grotesk](https://www.boldmonday.com/typeface/nitti-grotesk/) are two of my favorite families.

By the way, I'm trying to maintain a **[/now]({{ site.url }}/now)** page!

Oh, and I'm currently looking for a new job!
