I finally had a bit of time and energy to play around with the design of my personal website.

When I started using Jekyll, I looked for a long time to find a nice and minimal theme. The result was the minimal and responsive [Indigo Theme](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) by [Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). I think Indigo is an excellent theme but there were a few things that I was missing. So, I started tweaking things, and while I managed to add the stuff I wanted to, I realized that there are a lot of overhead that I don't really need. As Indigo started to shrink in size and complexity, I felt more comfortable digging into the SCSS and customizing the undelrying style. This went for a while, until I decided to completely replace the original CSS with [GitHub's Primer CSS Framework](https://primer.style/css/).

Prior to this, I did not have a lot of experience with CSS Frameworks. The last time that I kind of worked with a CSS Framework was when we built the DNAViewer for VUMC. We patched something together using the [Amazium](https://www.amazium.co.uk). It looked good, but I did not delve into the nitty-gritty of CSS. This time though, I did invest a bit of time reading about the modern CSS, and oh boy its much nicer and flexible. I quite like the new [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) and [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) concepts. There are understandable, not hack-y, and quite straightforward.


After a few round of reading, I started putting things together, and forming the main grid of the website.
