# Now

I’m currently **living** in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I’m **working**, as a PostDoc researcher, at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at the Tilburg University in the Netherlands. I’m **researching** and **modelling** the *p-hacking* phenomena, and interested in the application of *[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy?wprov=sfti1)* to improve the robustness of the hypothesis testing.

Besides my work, I’m **interested** in iOS and macOS apps, and I occasionally **write** about them, check [/u/amirmasoudabdol](https://reddit.com/u/amirmasoudabdol) and [@amirmasoudabdol](https://medium.com/@amirmasoudabdol). As a hobby, I’m occasionally **playing** video games, mainly *[Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/)* these days.

I've recently **finished** the book, [*Visualize This* by *Nathan Yau*](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/visualize-this/id443979379?at=1000l3&ct=rdd&l=en&mt=11). I enjoyed reading the book as it introduces fundamentals of the data visualization and design. Inspired by what I've learned from the book, I've started a small project in which I'd like to improve plots and figures that I see in publications. Read more about it [here]({{ site.url }}/visualization-project-a-better-plot), and check the first post [here]({{ site.url }}/likelihood-of-finding-null-effects-over-time).

Next, I would like to learn more about the data visualization and [Generative Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art); so, I would like to invest some time in refreshing my knowledge of [Processing](http://processing.org).

**Updated:** July, 2018.
