# Now

I’m moving back to Amsterdam! 

For some time now, I've been focused on the C++ programming language and further development of my simulator. I've encountered and solved a lot of issues and certainly learned a lot about C++. In the process, I read a few books. One that I really liked and I think it covered Modern C++ pretty nicely is [C++ Crash Course](https://ccc.codes/).

Besides my work, I’m starting to explore some low level programming concepts and solving programming puzzles every now and then. I’m going through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

These days, I’m reading the second book, [The Consuming Fire](http://www.librarything.com/work/20892979), of [The Interdepencency by John Scalzi](https://www.librarything.com/series/The+Interdependency). The first book, [The Collapsing Empire](http://www.librarything.com/work/17808669), was really good and it reminded me a lot of Asimov books. I totally recommend the book if you like geopolitics of Space!
