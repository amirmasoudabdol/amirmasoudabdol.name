I can *finally* say that I am out of academia, after almost a decade!

These days, I am looking for a new job while at the same time trying to write a bit more, see [here]({% post_url 2022-04-10-embedding-rframework-in-a-qt-mac-app-and-cross-compiling-for-two-architectures %}) and [here]({% post_url 2022-07-14-qmake-to-cmake %}). I am also working on a few projects, and trying to catch up with some of the newer technologies. I am reading about [Functional Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-plus-plus) and [Concurrency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3335772), and I am working on a few RStats related project, and tweaking every corner of this website! 👨🏻‍🎨

P.S. I am trying to get my driving license! 🚗🤞🏼
