# Now

After almost three years of working on my simulation framework. I'm now focused on finalizing everything and writing up a paper about it. If everything goes well, I should have everything ready before the summer. I made a quite nice documentation website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) that I reallt like. It looks good, and it has loads of content. I feel proud of it! 

In the meantime, I read a couple of self-improvement books to be able to cope with this long lockdown a bit better, e.g., [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear, [The Power of Habits](https://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/) by Charles Duhigg. And recently, I started reading the [Stuff Matters](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Stuff-Matters/9780544483941) by Mark Miodownik which is just delightful! üëåüèº

Oh, and I started brewing [Kombucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha?wprov=sfti1)!
