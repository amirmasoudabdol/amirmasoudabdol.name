I'm out of academia, after almost a decade! I mean, technically, I'm not; since I'm still working at the University of Amsterdam, as a software developer! I am one of the Core Developer of [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org), a statistical software that tries to rival big names like SPSS, and SAS. It's built on top of Qt framework, R.[^1]

These days, I'm mainly working on the back-end of the app, rewriting their build system, from Qmake to CMake, and upgrading some of their outdated procedures. We just merged this massive PR that I feel very proud of: [Qt 6.2 / C++17 / CMake](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspResults/pull/15). I think after dealing with the backend, I'm going to focus on integrating some more tools into their development pipelines to reduce the errors, and establish some coding standards, e.g., [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html), [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).

**Updated:** May 2nd, 2022.

[^1]: I will be stop working at JASP by the end of May 2022.
