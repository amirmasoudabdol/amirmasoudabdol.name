# Now

I’m currently **living** in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I’m **working**, as a PostDoc researcher, at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at the Tilburg University in the Netherlands. I’m **researching** and **modelling** the *p-hacking* phenomena, and interested in the application of *[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy?wprov=sfti1)* to improve the robustness of the hypothesis testing.

I’m **interested** in iOS and macOS apps and I occasionally **write** about them, check [/u/amirmasoudabdol](https://reddit.com/u/amirmasoudabdol) and [@amirmasoudabdol](https://medium.com/@amirmasoudabdol).

I’m **learning** [R](https://www.r-project.org) from [R in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action) and [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).

I’m **reading** the book, [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), by Daniel Kahneman.

I’m occasionally **playing** video games, mainly *[Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/)* these days.
