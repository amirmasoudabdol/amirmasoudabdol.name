<!-- # Preferably -->

During this lockdown period with long hours of screentime every day, my eyes started to become very sensitive to white background. Luckily, these days most websites and operation systems offer [Dark Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-on-dark_color_scheme) by default. However, I realized that the documentation websites of most R packages do not support dark theme, and since I'm working with R packages every day, I had to do something about it. So, I decided to develop a template for [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) that can take advantage of some of the modern capabalities of modern browsers.

From the project [website](https://preferably.amirmasoudabdol.name):

> preferably is an **accessible** template for [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) documentation websites. It uses a [light](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/) and a [dark](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/) theme and utilizes the [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) CSS variable to *automatically* serve either of the two based on users' operating system setting, or allowing them to manually toggle between them.

> Besides offering light and dark mode, I spent some time making the overall reading experience of 'pkgdown' documentations just a bit nicer, by using richer fonts, adopting a better color scheme for codes, etc.
